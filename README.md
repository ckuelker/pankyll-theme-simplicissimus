# Introduction

To understand what is needed to write a theme the [Pankyll] theme
[simplicissimus] can be used as an object of study.

# Installation

Consider using the [pankyll-theme-simplicissimus-example] skeleton to test out
the theme or to start a new site. However the installation by itself is just
cloning the theme into the `themes` directory.

```bash
cd  project/themes
git clone --recursive https://github.com/ckuelker/pankyll-theme-simplicissimus.git
```
